TUT03 25/09/2023 1-3pm
During the lab, we ran through all the user stories together as a team so that everyone is on the same page and that we are not missing the basic requirements. 
My task involves in creating the backlog in Jira and also arranging the sprint structure needed for the proposal.
We have also listed down the pages needed for the storyboard and the flow of the system for different user types.


Meeting 3/10/2023 8.30-9.30pm
Nicholas started on setting up the backend using MongoDB and Postman. He also asked the team to read a bit on mongoosejs. I will start a high fidelity in Figma. 

Novelty features:
	- Validation process for Professionals applying through a short quiz that tests the skills like for example React js

Pages:
	1. Landing 
	2. Registration
	3. Home
	4. Profile


#######################################
TUT04 4/10/2023 10-12pm
We will assign user stories to each member so that we can start coding.

WK5 Demo:
	- Present the application
	- Show the completed user stories on Jira
	- No need to make a presentation

I have completed the high fidelity for sprint 1 in Figma so that Satrio and I can refer to it when
coding the frontend. I have also created the logo and the colour palette for the platform.
I have also updated the README file for the dependencies I have installed.

Sheina Pages:
- Login
- Registration (Professional, Company)
- Home (Professional, Company)
- Profile (Professional, Company)
- View project lists
- View professional lists
- View company lists
- View professional's profile
- Company create new project post
- Header and footer
- Mock data for projects, professionals, companies

Satrio Pages:
- Landing
- Company's own projects list
- Company project details (new, ongoing, completed)

There was a miscommunication on who's making the registration pages but in the end we decided to use mine
since it's more detailed and more similar to the high fidelity.

Nicholas took lead in starting the backend and also delegated the tasks for the backend team.
He used Mongoose JS driver, MongoDB and Postman for the backend. He created a gmail account for the
Postman and also shared with the frontend team on how the backend works.

Meeting 09/10/2023 12-1pm
The team met on campus to finalise and go through together for the demo, and also explain and show the 
backend and frontend we have accomplished.

TUT05 09/10/2023 1-3pm
We presented our demo and the progress we have made for sprint 1. We have finished both frontend and backend,
however, we have not integrate them together for the first sprint.

Frontend:
- fix pages landing (Satrio & Sheina), projects list (Satrio), project details page (Satrio)
- integrate backend from register and login
- fix header and make sure everything is sprint 1 is correct before starting sprint 2.

Everyone:
- Finish retrospective A report
- Start sprint 2

Retrospective A Meeting 10/10/2023 5-6pm
We went through what went wrong, what could be better, what should we do to improve, while documenting
it on the report. I submitted the report afterwards but realised few days later that it was not
received on Moodle so I resubmitted the report.

Meeting 13/10/2023 2.45-4pm (With Vincent only) 4-5pm (With the whole group)
Meeting to integrate the frontend and backend as well as going through the demo recording. I have created
a slide to show the scope and context of the project using Canva. I will go through the project description
aspect and record the frontend. Then, I will combine with the backend demo recorded by Nick.
I have created a channel on Microsoft Teams to publish the recording demo with Dr. Basem and the team.

Setting up Backend on Mac:
1. Install mongodb using homebrew and install the compass GUI.
2. Set up the .env file
3. Start the mongo services
- brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
4. Run the backend using npm run dev
5. Stop mongo services when stopping backend too
- brew services stop mongodb-community@7.0

To export and import data
mongodump -d webApp
