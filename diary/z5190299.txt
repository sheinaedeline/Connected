TUT03 25/09/2023 1-3pm
During the lab, we ran through all the user stories together as a team so that everyone is on the same page and that we are not missing the basic requirements. 
My task involves in creating the backlog in Jira and also arranging the sprint structure needed for the proposal.
We have also listed down the pages needed for the storyboard and the flow of the system for different user types.


Meeting 3/10/2023 8.30-9.30pm
Nicholas started on setting up the backend using MongoDB and Postman. He also asked the team to read a bit on mongoosejs. I will start a high fidelity in Figma. 

Novelty features:
	- Validation process for Professionals applying through a short quiz that tests the skills like for example React js

Pages:
	1. Landing 
	2. Registration
	3. Home
	4. Profile

TUT04 4/10/2023 10-12pm
We will assign user stories to each member so that we can start coding.

WK5 Demo:
	- Present the application
	- Show the completed user stories on Jira
	- No need to make a presentation

I have completed the high fidelity for sprint 1 in Figma so that Satrio and I can refer to it when
coding the frontend. I have also created the logo and the colour palette for the platform.

Sheina Pages:
- Login
- Registration (Professional, Company)
- Home (Professional, Company)
- Profile (Professional, Company)
- View project lists
- View professional lists
- View company lists
- View professional's profile
- Company create new project post
- Header and footer

Satrio Pages:
- Landing
- Company's own projects list
- Company project details (new, ongoing, completed)

There was a miscommunication on who's making the registration pages but in the end we decided to use mine
since it's more detailed and more similar to the high fidelity.

Nicholas took lead in starting the backend and also delegated the tasks for the backend team.
He used Mongoose JS driver, MongoDB and Postman for the backend. He created a gmail account for the
Postman and also shared with the frontend team on how the backend works.
