During the lab, we ran through all the user stories together as a team so that everyone is on the same page and that we are not missing the basic requirements. 
My task involves in creating the backlog in Jira and also arranging the sprint structure needed for the proposal.
We have also listed down the pages needed for the storyboard and the flow of the system for different user types.
